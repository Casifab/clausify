The project consist in two file, one written in prolog and one in lisp that could rewrite WFF (well formed formulae) of the FOL (first order logic) in the equivalent CNF (conjunctive natural form) expression.

The lisp's dialect is **Common Lisp**, the prolog's **SWI Prolog**.

Uses instruction are contained in the respective READMEs.

Thanks to Alessandro Guidi and Mattia Amico for the prolog's part.
